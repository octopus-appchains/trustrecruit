### An NFT Resume Marketplace to disrupt the recruitment industry globally.


TrustRecruit leverages the immutability and decentralized ledgerization of blockchain to redefine the recruitment process. Utilizing the Substrate framework to create an ecosystem of a trustless and secure recruitment process, TrustRecruit enables both recruiters and recruits to boost their outreach while gaining credibility through the underlying Octopus framework using Rust programming. 

A unique method of leveling up the asset tokenization into identity verification and document authentication mechanism by forming NFTs of resumes that can be matched to the requirements posted on the platform by verified recruiters, Trustrecruit envisions a seamless, unified, and global recruitment platform.
